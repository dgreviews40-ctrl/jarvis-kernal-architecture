# 🎉 SUCCESS! JARVIS is Working!

## ✅ What's Working:

These models work perfectly with your API key:
- ✅ **gemini-2.0-flash** (fastest, recommended)
- ✅ **gemini-2.5-flash** (speed optimized)
- ✅ **gemini-1.5-flash** (standard)

## ❌ What Doesn't Work:

- ❌ **gemini-1.5-pro** - Not compatible with v1beta API

The Pro model requires a different API endpoint that this SDK version doesn't support.
Use `gemini-2.5-flash` for the best quality instead!

- **API Key:** Configured ✅

You shared your API key in chat. After confirming everything works:

1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Delete the key: `AIzaSyCPSTJuVDqp_M_h536Hic6YIhLWnIAyN7I`
3. Create a new one
4. Update it in JARVIS Settings

This prevents anyone who saw this conversation from using your key.
